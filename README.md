# Space Frontier

This is, at its core, a simple Asteroids-style 2d space shooter. However, enough features are added on top of that to make it (hopefully) interesting.

Like the game it is inspired by, Stellar Frontier, there are multiple AI ships, and you can order them around, effectively making it an arcade-RTS combo.

I have also added procedurally generated elements while striving to keep it realistic.

It is not an exact port, rather, it aims for the spirit while modernizing the user experience and drastically simplifying some overcomplicated code and concepts.

Those projects allowed me to implement procedural stars and planets, citing astronomy sources:
