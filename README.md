# Space Frontier

This is, at its core, a simple Asteroids-style 2d space shooter. However, enough features are added on top of that to make it (hopefully) interesting.

Like the game it is inspired by, Stellar Frontier, there are multiple AI ships, and you can order them around, effectively making it an arcade-RTS combo.

I have also added procedurally generated elements while striving to keep it realistic.

This project stands on the shoulders of giants:

* Stellar Frontier by Stardock Corporation (source-available license)

It is not an exact port, rather, it aims for the spirit while modernizing the user experience and drastically simplifying some overcomplicated code and concepts.

Those projects allowed me to implement procedural stars and planets, citing astronomy sources:

* [Pioneer](https://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer) - note, none of their code or assets is actually used so I don't need to license this under GPL
* [Stellar Dream](https://github.com/irskep/stellardream)
* [Accrete](https://github.com/zakski/accrete-starform-stargen)


Actual astronomy data comes from:

* [Johnston Archive](https://www.johnstonsarchive.net/astro/nearstar.html) - which itself cites many sources, among them RECONS and Gaia data release 1
* [Gruze](https://gruze.org/10pc/) which relies mostly on Gaia data (lots of stuff but distances seem to be missing)
* [Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia](http://exoplanet.eu) and [Open Exoplanet Catalogue](http://openexoplanetcatalogue.com) which seem to be aggregates, mostly based on SIMBAD and Gaia
* [Stellar Catalog](https://www.stellarcatalog.com) which is another aggregate, also known as Living Future (livingfuture.cz)
